# About
This project was submitted as my bachelor thesis in [Teknik Perminyakan ITB][]. It attempts to produce an implementation of finite-difference method to solve diffusivity equation for *single-phase* fluid flow in porous media in the form of Python code. My cause behind this project was because many *undergraduate* students in [Petroleum Engineering][] seem to fail to completely understand how a reservoir simulator works behind the monitor (how to numerically solve the diffusivity equation). Thus, I aim to show how the equation is *put into code* and how to generate the solution for each time level.

<!--Note: My pure and naive motivation was because I just wanted to code ;).-->
